# Sleight

A wordplay on **S**tatus **Light**, gone sleightly wrong.

## Description
This is a testbed for experimenting with Qt5/QML in scope of Status Desktop client development.

It expects a status-go library headers in `include/libstatus.h` and static library in `lib/libstatus.a`.

Currently it supports account creation, login, and calling JSON RPC methods of status-go. In a very basic form.
